# MMSS 211-3 Formal Models in Political Science

During this quarter long course, I learned about the theory and applications of formal models in political science, from spatial and contagion models to linear regression and network models.

#### This github repository displays the R code that I wrote to create those models for various assignments throughout the quarter. I myself chose the topics that I explored through each model.

The spatial model file's name is self explanatory. The Bass model is a type of contagion model. The B1G recruiting code file displays code for a network model and the B1G Basketball final project file displays code for another network model.
